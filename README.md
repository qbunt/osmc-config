This is a config file for mount-at-boot on a Raspberry Pi for an Airport Extreme connected hard drive.

This is specifically for mounting the contents of
    //192.168.1.1/volumename
Directly to
    /mnt/airport

This is also specifically set up for a SMB mount, so if you try this with a Netatalk/AFP share, it won't work correctly and potentially prevent a clean boot.
